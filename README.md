# Monte-Carlo Simulation: Blackjack

This project stimulates a simple version of the card game Blackjack by comparing the winning percentage of the player in response to different sets of rules using array and arraylist data structures. 

The result of the simulation is a text-based version of the game and its text-based simulation report which runs in the terminal.

## Description

By leveraging Java to compare the winning percentage of the player in response to different sets of rules and decision strategies, I was able to examine the
properties of the Blackjack game as following: According to this report, applying more complex decision strategies for the player increased the chance of winning, which makes sense because the hard totals and soft totals rules take into account the dealerâ€™s first card as an important additional cue. However, when applying the soft totals rule in a non-Ace-rule Blackjack game, the player loses winning percentage significantly, because sof total is only meaningful with Ace rule. Also, in general, the Ace Rule gives additional advantage for the player, possibly because this rule only applies to the player. There is a low chance for one to get a Real Blackjack, so it makes sense that the real Blackjack rule does not interfere with winning percentage.
